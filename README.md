# node-bugseverywhere

Api to access [bugseverywhere](http://http://bugseverywhere.org/) from node. 

***STATUS***: Under development


## Install

To install libyaml on Debian like systems type:

    sudo aptitude install libyaml-dev

make sure you have `node-waf` installed (contained in `nodejs-dev` package). You need libyaml installed localy.

    npm install bugseverywhere


## API

The Api tries to mimeic the original bugseverywhere [API](http://docs.bugseverywhere.org/libbe.html) but uses a async
design where possible and usefull.

### FIXME

Under heavy development, therefore undocmented ;-)
